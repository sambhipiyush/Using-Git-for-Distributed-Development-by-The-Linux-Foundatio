00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.111
To get some grasp of what distributed development looks like, and

2
00:00:05.111 --> 00:00:11.383
how git handles the repositories for that, let's look at git.kernel.org,

3
00:00:11.383 --> 00:00:15.731
which contains a large number of git repositories for

4
00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:20.280
projects that are somehow related to the Linux kernel.

5
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.760
And so we can see the name and description,

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.550
the owner, and various statistics for a large number of repositories here.

7
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.590
We could look at any one of them, but why don't we look at the main Linux kernel

8
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.659
repository, which would be easy to find because it's owned by Linus Torvalds.

9
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.080
And here's... right here, the kernel source tree, so let's look at that.

10
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.070
And you'll see, first, it lists the branches here. He just has a master and

11
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.793
a work-in-progress (WIP) branch.

12
00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:58.128
Tags are various known states that are easily reverted to instead

13
00:00:58.128 --> 00:01:03.950
of typing long hexidecimal numbers that are used for commits.

14
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.050
These are commit messages, and these are various places you can clone or

15
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.804
copy the repository from, using the git protocol in the first one, or

16
00:01:13.804 --> 00:01:16.680
the HTTP protocol in the further ones.

17
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.497
If I go back to the top, if I look at stats here, see, these are the people

18
00:01:21.497 --> 00:01:26.730
who have been contributing recently, and the number of commits.

19
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.780
This is by week.

20
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.240
If I want to get longer statistics, let me switch to quarter.

21
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.950
And you'll see there are many more people listed here.

22
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.950
You'll notice, by the way, Linus' name doesn't even come up in the top group in

23
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.840
here, that's because he mostly is taking commits from other people and

24
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.290
then feeding them into the master branch.

25
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.150
So, he doesn't make that many commits on his own.

26
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.320
And, if we go back to the summary here,

27
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.829
notice, if I want to look at the actual changes, I could look, say, at commit.

28
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.083
And, this will be a recent one that Linus committed,

29
00:02:07.083 --> 00:02:09.600
okay, which contains a number of changes.

30
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.840
These are all the different files that were changed.

31
00:02:13.803 --> 00:02:20.890
If I look at the dif here, I can see also particular patches that were done.

32
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.460
And you see the plus signs are lines which have been added, the minus signs are lines

33
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.040
which have been removed, so there's a one line change right here.

34
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.490
And then, there's some lines before and after, which are given for context.

35
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.612
And then, here's the various logs, so, for instance, if I want to look at any

36
00:02:45.612 --> 00:02:50.550
particular one here, let's just pick one here from Jeff Laten.

37
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.783
You see, there's the author, and then, the committer is the one who actually put

38
00:02:55.783 --> 00:03:01.040
it into the kernel, so this first person must have passed it to the next one.

39
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.598
Notice that all patches have a Signed-off-by field, or

40
00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:06.820
one or more Signed-off-by fields.

41
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.240
These are people that are responsible for the changes.

42
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.882
And, for instance, if they stole lines of code from some other project, or

43
00:03:15.882 --> 00:03:20.607
proprietary projects, and they did something that violated licenses,

44
00:03:20.607 --> 00:03:23.024
we would know exactly who to blame.

45
00:03:23.024 --> 00:03:27.000
So one, I recommend that you go look at this website and

46
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.063
examine some projects that you may find interesting and

47
00:03:31.063 --> 00:03:36.090
get a sense of who is making changes and what the workflow looks like.
